# What is OSDU?
OSDU (Open Standard Data Platform for Upstream) is an open data platform for the upstream oil and gas industry. It is designed to provide a standardized, cloud-based platform for storing and managing data related to exploration, drilling, and production activities in the upstream oil and gas industry. The goal of OSDU is to improve data interoperability and accessibility within the industry, enabling more efficient and effective data management and analysis. OSDU is being developed by the OSDU Forum, a consortium of oil and gas companies and technology providers working together to define and implement the platform.
